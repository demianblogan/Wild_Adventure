// libs/DualSenseWindows/. Windows exposes no public vendor API for these
// controllers -- XInput doesn't cover them at all -- so this library talks
// to the hardware directly over raw HID (SetupAPI/hid.lib), matching it by
// its USB vendor/product ID. See libs/DualSenseWindows/LICENSE.

	// rumble"/"set this color" calls into whatever that hardware actually
	// expects.
